# Earthquacke_data
In this project I have created a gui which shows the real time data of the earthquake around the world on a world map using USCD Unfolding maps library in java. The earthquake have been marked on the basis of there magnitude, as shown in the following project:

The gui also contain multiple event listener, like -
1. When you click on a earthquake it will show the magnitude of the earthquake, the city and the country at which the earthquacke occured
2 . When you click on a city it will show all the earthquake that had happened recently in that city with there average magnitude.
3. When you hover over a marker it gives you little info regarding that marker.
